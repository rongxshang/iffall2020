        <h1>(modern) tomatoes & eggs</h1>
        <div>A classic comfort Chinese dish, tomatoes and eggs (番茄炒蛋) is probably the first dish many Chinese-Americans learn how to make (myself included!) since it requires minimal ingredients and time. The more common style is with the eggs set into large curds, but personally, I prefer a more custard-y consistency that is perfect on top of rice (the traditional way) or here over toast.

                        I tend to go with an 2:2 tomato to egg ratio per person to easily scale this recipe up or down.

                        Shaoxing rice wine is a traditional Chinese wine fermented from rice and can be found in Asian grocery stores or even on
                        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soeos-Chinese-Shaohsing-Cooking-Shaoxing/dp/B07K6VD6DL">Amazon.</a>
                        However, it can be substituted with mirin, cooking, or white wine. Other common versions of this dish include sugar, Chinese black vinegar, or white pepper.
