        <h1>tomatoes & eggs (番茄炒蛋)</h1>
        <div>A classic comfort Chinese dish, tomatoes and eggs (番茄炒蛋) is probably one of first dishes many Chinese-Americans learn how to make (myself included!) since it requires minimal ingredients and time. Every family has their own version of this dish but the more common style is with the eggs set into large curds. Personally, my family and I prefer a more custard-y consistency that is perfect on top of rice and noodles.

                <ul>
                    <li>4 medium tomatoes (around 1 pound)</li>
                    <li>4 eggs</li>
                    <li>salt (to taste)</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon white pepper</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing or cooking rice wine </li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon minced ginger (about 1/4-inch nub)</li>
                    <li>3 scallions</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional)</li>

                <h2>instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by cutting tomatoes into small wedges and finely chop the scallions.</li>
                    <li>Crack 4 eggs into a bowl and season with ¼ teaspoon white pepper, ½ teaspoon sesame oil, 1 teaspoon Shaoxing rice wine and salt to taste. Beat eggs until yolk and whites are well-incorporated. </li>
                    <li>To a pan over medium heat, add oil and ginger and cook until aromatic, about 15 seconds. Add the tomatoes and salt to taste (and sugar if desired) and cook, stirring occasionally, until the flesh has softened but still has some shape and the juices have begun to form a sauce (around 2-3 minutes.)  </li>
                    <li>Add the eggs to the pan by pouring it circularly into the softened tomatoes. The eggs should form an even layer on top of the tomatoes. Cover the pan to allow the eggs to softly set. </li>
                    <li>Mix eggs into tomatoes. The eggs should have custard-like, runny consistency with some larger curds. Continue to stir occasionally until eggs are cooked through. </li>
                    <li>Garnish with chopped scallions and serve on top of rice or noodles.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
